    compartmental epidemic models
  package_name: epimodels 
  project_name: Epidemic Modeling Framework

  python_version: '3.11'
  version: v0.1.0

days: 160
noise_std: 5.0
subset_ratio: 0.7
optimizers: [Nelder-Mead, BFGS, L-BFGS-B]

SIR_model:
  compartments: [S, I, R]
  parameters: {beta: 0.3, gamma: 0.1, mu: 0.01}
  transitions: {"S -> I": "beta * S * I / N", "I -> R": "gamma * I", "-> S": "mu * N", "S ->": "mu * S", "I ->": "mu * I", "R ->": "mu * R"}
  population: 1000

  assunptions: The population is closed (no births or deaths). The disease is transmitted through direct contact. Immunity is permanent after recovery.'
 
SEIR_model:
 compartments: [S, E, I, R] 
 parameters: {beta: 0.3, sigma: 0.1, gamma: 0.1, mu: 0.01}
 transitions: {"S -> E": "beta * S * I / N", "E -> I": "sigma * E", "I -> R": "gamma * I", "-> S": "mu * N", "S ->": "mu * S", "E ->": "mu * E", "I ->": "mu * I", "R ->": "mu * R"}
 population: 1000
 initial_conditions: {S: 990, E: 0, I: 10, R: 0}
 assumptions: The population is closed (no births or deaths). The disease has an exposed stage before becoming infectious. Immunity is permanent after recovery.

SIS_model:
  compartments: [S, I]
  parameters: {beta: 0.3, gamma: 0.1, mu: 0.01}
  transitions: {"S -> I": "beta * S * I / N", "I -> S": "gamma * I", "-> S": "mu * N", "S ->": "mu * S", "I ->": "mu * I"}
  population: 1000
  initial_conditions: {S: 990, I: 10}
  assumptions: The population is closed (no births or deaths). The disease does not confer permanent immunity. After recovery, individuals return to the susceptible class (no immunity).
