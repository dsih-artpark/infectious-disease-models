# Epidemic Modeling Framework

Welcome to the documentation for **Epidemic Modeling Framework**!

## Project Overview
This project implements a flexible, configurable framework for simulating and fitting compartmental epidemiological models such as SIR, SEIR, SEIRS, etc.

Features include:
- ODE-based simulation
- Synthetic noise injection
- Parameter fitting via multiple optimizers
- MCMC-based posterior sampling
