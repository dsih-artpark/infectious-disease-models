# Generalized Compartmental Epidemiological Modeling Framework

Welcome to the documentation for a flexible framework to simulate, analyze, and fit a wide variety of compartmental epidemiological models (e.g., SIR, SEIR, SIS, etc.).

This project supports:

- Simulation of compartmental models using ODEs
- Injection of synthetic noise into generated data
- Parameter estimation using optimization techniques and MCMC
- Visualization of simulations, fittings, and posteriors

This documentation will guide you through installation, usage, configuration, methodology, and implementation details.
