# Methodology

## Problem Statement
Clear description of the problem being solved and the objectives.

## Approach
Overview of the analytical approach and methodology.

## Mathematical Framework

### Key Equations
Here are some example equations using LaTeX syntax:

The mean squared error (MSE) is calculated as:

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

For a linear regression model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
$$
