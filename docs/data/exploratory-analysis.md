# Exploratory Data Analysis (Spatio-Temporal)

## Overview
Briefly describe the goals of the exploratory analysis and the main questions being investigated.

## Summary Statistics
- Overview of key variables
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, min, max, etc.)
- Distribution of variables (histograms, boxplots)

## Spatial Analysis
- Description of spatial features (e.g., locations, regions)
- Spatial distribution plots (maps, heatmaps)
- Spatial autocorrelation or clustering (if applicable)

## Temporal Analysis
- Time range covered by the data
- Trends over time (line plots, seasonal decomposition)
- Temporal aggregation (daily, weekly, monthly summaries)

## Spatio-Temporal Patterns
- Analysis of how variables change over space and time
- Animated or faceted plots (if available)

## Key Plots
- Insert or describe key plots used in the analysis:
  - Histogram of main variable(s)
  - Boxplot by region or time period
  - Map visualizations (choropleth, scatter, heatmap)
  - Time series plots
  - Any interactive or animated plots (describe or link)

## Insights
- Main findings from the exploratory analysis
- Notable patterns, anomalies, or trends
- Implications for further analysis or modeling
