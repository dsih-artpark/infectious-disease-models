# Time varying Parmeters

In real-world epidemic modeling, parameters such as the infection rate (β) or recovery rate (γ) rarely stay constant.
They can change over time due to interventions, behavior changes, vaccination drives, or environmental factors.

Our framework supports time-varying parameters through a flexible design that lets you define parameter schedules, generate parameter series, and integrate them directly into simulations and calibration workflows.
